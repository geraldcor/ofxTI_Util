This is just a github post of the code attached to this thread:
http://forum.openframeworks.cc/index.php?topic=3705.5

It's only here so people can compile ofxMotionTracker (https://github.com/jamezilla/ofxMotionTracker).

I made some small patches to get everything to compile, but otherwise
the code is unmodified. I believe all the credit goes to Tangible
Interactive for this bundle.
